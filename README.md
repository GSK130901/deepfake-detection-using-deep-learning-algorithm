# deepfake-detection-using-deep-learning-algorithm
This is a fake video detection project which aims to identify manipulated videos using a deep learning algorithm 
that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
networks. The model is trained on labelled video datasets, distinguishing between real and fake 
videos.
